## Installation ##

1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
1. Set write permission (777) to the plugin dir folder => `/wp-content/plugins/wp-mpdf/cache`
1. Go to the plugins page and activate the plugin.
1. Add to your template "`<?php if(function_exists('mpdf_pdfbutton')) mpdf_pdfbutton(); ?>`" as a small button or "`<?php if(function_exists('mpdf_pdfbutton')) mpdf_pdfbutton(false, 'my link', 'my login text'); ?>`" as a textlink. The second text specifies the text which should displayed if you have checked "needs login" and a user isn't loggend in. (if you wish to open the pdf print in a new tab you may pass "true" for the first parameter)
1. You can adjust some options: in your admin interface, click on plugins and then on wp-mpdf. For allowing or disabling pdf export you can use the checkbox when creating/editing a post or a page.
1. Place your templates into `/wp-content/wp-mpdf-themes`

The mpdf_pdfbutton function signature: `function mpdf_pdfbutton($opennewtab=false, $buttontext = '', $logintext = 'Login!', $print_button = true, $nofollow = false, $options = array())`

The options array supports 'pdf_lock_image' => '/my/image/path/relative/to/wordpress/route' and 'pdf_image' => '/my/image/path/relative/to/wordpress/route' to overwrite which icon should be used.
