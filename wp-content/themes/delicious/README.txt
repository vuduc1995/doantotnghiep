In addition, the Delicious child theme creates the following thumbnail images you'll see below, which are defined (and can be modified) in the functions.php file. These are the recommended thumbnail sizes that are used on the Delicious child theme demo site.

The Delicious child theme comes with 3 color styles - style.css, blue.css, and brown.css. To select the stylesheet which will get loaded, simply go to the Genesis > Theme Settings page in your WordPress dashboard and look for the Delicious Color Style option box.
