WIDGET AREAS
Primary Sidebar - This is the primary sidebar if you are using the Content/Sidebar or Sidebar/Content Site Layout option.

FEATURED IMAGES
By default WordPress will create a default thumbnail image for each image you upload and the size can be specified in your dashboard under Settings > Media. In addition, the Generate Pro Theme creates the following thumbnail images you'll see below, which are defined (and can be modified) in the functions.php file. These are the recommended thumbnail sizes that are used on the Generate Pro Theme demo site.
