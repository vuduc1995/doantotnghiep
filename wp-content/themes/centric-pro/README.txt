FEATURED IMAGES
By default WordPress will create a default thumbnail image for each image you upload and the size can be specified in your dashboard under Settings > Media. In addition, the Centric theme creates the following thumbnail images you'll see below, which are defined (and can be modified) in the functions.php file. These are the recommended thumbnail sizes that are used on the Centric theme demo site.

featured-page - 960px by 700px
featured-post - 400px by 300px

LOCALIZATION
